# Rainwater-Detector
Rain Detector Using Solar Powered Model 
Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Rain Detector System integrated with a solar-powered house model. The system detects rainfall using a rain sensor and alerts the user through a buzzer when rain is detected. The project highlights the use of renewable solar energy along with basic sensing and alert mechanisms.

Objective

- To detect the presence of rain automatically
- To provide an alert using a buzzer when rain is detected
- To demonstrate the practical use of rain sensors
- To utilize solar energy as a power source
- To promote awareness of renewable energy and automation

Components Used

- Rain sensor module
- Solar panel
- Cardboard house model
- Rechargeable battery (9V)
- Switch
- Buzzer
- Connecting wires
- Wooden base board

Working Principle

The rain sensor detects water droplets when rain falls on its surface.
When rain is detected, the sensor sends a signal that activates the buzzer.
The solar panel converts sunlight into electrical energy and charges the battery.
The stored energy powers the rain detection system, making it energy-efficient and eco-friendly.
